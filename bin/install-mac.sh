# Install gcc
# We want a stable version of gcc 11.2 (needed for cryptopp to compile correctly), 
# so we checkout the latest version of brew that has this version, install gcc,
# pin it, and then return brew to the correct version. The version info of
# gcc or g++ then is:
#               g++ (Homebrew GCC 11.2.0_3) 11.2.0
# See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39187812/homebrew-how-to-install-older-versions
# If you have already installed a newer version of gcc, you can uninstall it  (brew uninstall gcc) 
# and then run these commands again. The linking below won't need to be rerun.

# We link the homebrew gcc and g++ symbols to gcc-11 and g++-11
# This may not be needed anymore since we go to a point in the homebrew git log
# where we are sure that "gcc" refers to gcc-11, but for now we will keep this 
# in case it is still needed (the next time someone does a clean install we
# can see if it is really neccesary).
